**Industrial Copper Modeling Project**
Enhancing Decision-Making in the Copper Industry Using Machine Learning

**Overview**
This project applies machine learning to tackle challenges within the copper industry, specifically focusing on sales and pricing data. The main objective is to develop predictive models to improve decision-making processes by addressing issues such as data skewness, noise, and lead classification.

**Skills Acquired**
Python Programming: Master Python and key libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, detect outliers, and normalize data effectively.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize data insights with methods like boxplots and scatter plots.
Machine Learning: Build robust regression and classification models.
Web Application Development: Develop interactive applications using Streamlit.

**Problem Statement**
The copper industry often encounters challenges with skewed and noisy sales and pricing data, which can reduce the accuracy of manual predictions. Manual processes are time-consuming and may not provide optimal pricing decisions. This project aims to create:

**A Regression Model** to predict the continuous variable, Selling Price.
**A Classification Model** to evaluate leads based on their conversion likelihood (status: WON or LOST).

**Data Description**
The dataset includes the following columns:

id: Unique identifier for each transaction
item_date: Date of the transaction
quantity_tons: Quantity sold in tons
customer: Identifier for the customer
country: Customer's country
status: Current status of the transaction (WON or LOST)
item_type: Category of items sold
application: Specific use of items
thickness, width: Dimensions of the items
material_ref, product_ref: References for materials/products
delivery_date: Expected delivery date
selling_price: Price at which items are sold


**Approach**
1. Data Understanding
Identify variable types (continuous, categorical) and analyze their distributions.
Convert invalid values in reference columns (e.g., '00000') to null.
2. Data Preprocessing
Handle Missing Values: Apply mean/median/mode strategies.
Outlier Treatment: Use IQR or Isolation Forest from Scikit-learn.
Address Skewness: Apply log or Box-Cox transformations for continuous variables.
Encoding: Use one-hot or label encoding for categorical variables.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualize outliers and skewness using Seabornâ€™s boxplot and violin plot.
4. Feature Engineering
Create new features if applicable.
Drop highly correlated columns using heatmaps.
5. Model Building and Evaluation
Split dataset into training and testing sets.
Train classification models (e.g., ExtraTreesClassifier, XGBClassifier) and regression models, assessing performance using accuracy, precision, and recall.
Optimize models with cross-validation and grid search.
6. Model Deployment
Deploy models with Streamlit, creating an interactive app where users can input data to receive predictions for Selling Price or Lead Status.
