**Industrial Copper Modeling Project**

**Project Overview**
The Industrial Copper Modeling Project leverages advanced machine learning techniques to address challenges in the copper industry. The primary focus is on analyzing sales and pricing data to develop predictive models that enhance decision-making processes. These models aim to tackle issues such as data skewness, noise, and lead classification, providing actionable insights into pricing strategies and customer behavior.

**Problem Statement**
The copper industry faces significant challenges in analyzing sales and pricing data due to:

**Data Skewness**: Affects the accuracy of predictive models.
Noise and Outliers: Introduce variability, reducing the reliability of manual or basic statistical methods.
Manual Lead Classification: Time-intensive and error-prone processes for evaluating leads (status: WON or LOST).
To address these, we developed:

**A Regression Model** to predict the continuous variable, selling_price.
**A Classification Model** to evaluate leads based on their likelihood of conversion (status: WON or LOST).

**Data Description**
The dataset used for this project contains the following columns:

id: Unique identifier for each transaction.
item_date: Date of the transaction.
quantity_tons: Quantity sold in tons.
customer: Customer identifier.
country: Customer's country.
status: Transaction status (WON or LOST).
item_type: Category of items sold.
application: Specific use of items.
thickness, width: Physical dimensions of the items.
material_ref, product_ref: Material and product references.
delivery_date: Expected delivery date.
selling_price: Price at which items are sold.


**Why This Model Was Selected**
Challenges Addressed by Machine Learning
Handling Skewness: Models normalize skewed data to improve accuracy.
Robust to Noise and Outliers: Techniques like Isolation Forest and Random Forest handle variability effectively.
Enhanced Lead Classification: Machine learning provides precise evaluation of lead conversion likelihood.
Superiority Over Alternatives
Manual Approaches: Time-intensive and error-prone.
Basic Statistical Models: Fail to capture complex, non-linear relationships.
Machine Learning Models: Excel in robustness and predictive accuracy.

**Data Analysis Workflow**

**1. Data Preprocessing**
Handling Missing Values: Applied mean/median imputation.
Outlier Treatment: Used IQR and Isolation Forest methods.
Skewness Treatment: Log transformations reduced skewness in continuous variables like selling_price.
Categorical Encoding: Converted variables (e.g., customer, country, application) using one-hot encoding.

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
EDA was conducted using various graphical methods:

Boxplots: Highlighted outliers in selling_price, informing preprocessing strategies.
Scatter Plots: Demonstrated relationships between features like quantity_tons and selling_price.
Violin Plots: Illustrated differences in selling_price distributions across categories like application.
Histograms: Visualized frequency distributions to address skewness.
Pairplots: Detected feature correlations, guiding feature engineering.

**Model Selection and Rationale**
**Explored Algorithms**
Linear Regression: Simple but unsuitable for non-linear data relationships.
Decision Tree Regressor/Classifier: Effective but prone to overfitting.
Random Forest Regressor/Classifier (Selected): Robust, interpretable, and highly accurate.
XGBoost: High-performing but overly complex for this dataset.
Final Models Used
Random Forest Regressor: For predicting selling_price.
Random Forest Classifier: For classifying lead status (WON/LOST).

**Why Random Forest?**
Robust against noise, outliers, and skewness.
Handles both linear and non-linear relationships.
Provides feature importance insights for transparency.
Demonstrated superior performance metrics compared to alternatives.
